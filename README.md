# Scrape MIT Tech Articles for keywords

Runtime is (empirically) 2 minutes per year (<= 60 articles per year).

To run, first download the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`. Then, run `scrape.py` - make sure to edit the keywords you're interested in, the year range (reference the Tech issues page to determine which tech issue dates correspond to which years), and the output file which will print links to the relevant articles.
